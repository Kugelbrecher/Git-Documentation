# Git Commands

Documentation [here](https://git-scm.com/doc)

## 1. [git fetch](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-fetch), [git merge](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-merge), [git pull](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-pull)

Fetch: 
- When no remote is specified, by default the `origin` remote will be used, unless thereâ€™s an upstream branch configured for the current branch.
- Q: why fatal error when `git fetch origin/main` to local main branch? (fatal: 'origin/main' does not appear to be a git repository fatal: Could not read from remote repository.)

Difference between `git fetch` and `git pull`:
- `git fetch` asks git if the remote has any updates that the local work directory doesn't have. It does not involve in file transferring from remote to local git work repository.
- `git pull` pull remote changes if there are any. `git pull` command involve in file transferring from remote repo to local git repository
